class ViewController: UIViewController {
    
//  1.Navigate to the ViewController file. Declare one function called arrayWithFibonacciSequenceToIndex which takes one Int argument called index and returns an Array of Ints.
//  2.Since the sequence requires the two previous numbers to calculate the next one, we need to prime the sequence. To do this, we're going to need to manually pass in 0 and 1
//  3. Now it's time to implement the algorithm. Chain an else statement to the if and else if statements to set a default behavior for every iteration of the loop after the first two. In order to calculate the next fibonacci number in the sequence, we're going to need to:
//    
//    pull the previous two numbers out of the sequence,
//    calculate the next fibonacci number in the sequence by the finding the sum of the two integers, and
//    add the new fibonacci number to the sequence.
